# Regular-Expression-Helper Stage 1
1. Thank you for proceeding me to Stage 1.
2. Before implementing, I referred to the link provided in the document to learn more about regular expressions.
3. I used basic Front-end involving Html, CSS and JS
4. I used some standard websites like regexr.com , etc. Then crossed checked answers.
5. I believe the implementation works as per the instructions provided, but please let me know if there are any issues.
6. Please feel free to suggest any modifications.
7. Finally, I apologize for being late in completing this task. I was working on developing a Flutter-based app for a Ugandan NGO project aimed at assisting war refugees by Amrita CREATE, and thus it took me some extra time to complete both tasks.
